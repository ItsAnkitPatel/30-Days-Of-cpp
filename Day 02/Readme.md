## Lecture - 3 Summary
### Topic - Variables & Comments
Variables are just containers which help us to store data.

Comments `//` is a way of coveying message to the compiler that you don't need to compile this part of line.

`//` is used as single line comment. For mutiple line comments we use `/**/` everything written between these two asterisk will not be compiled by the compiler.

## Lecture - 4 Summmary
### Topic - Variables Scope and Data Types
Variables can be of different types. Primarily we have these variable types in C++:

```c++
- byte        (1 byte)  
- short       (2 byte)
- int         (4 byte)
- long int    (8 byte)
- long        (8 byte)
- float       (4 byte)
- double      (8 byte)
- char        (1 byte)
- bool        (1 byte)
```

#### Syntax for declaring variables in C++
>Data_type Variable_name = Value;

int a =4;

##### Based on scope variables can be classified into two types:
1. Local Variable
2. Global Variable

**Variable scope** : Scope of a variable is a region in code where the existence of variable is valid.
  
  **Local Variables** : Local variables are declared inside the braces of any function and can be accessed only from there.<br>
  **Global Variables** : Global variables are declared outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere.

### Data types in C++ are categorised in three groups:
  - Bult-in
  - User-defined
  - Derived

#### Built-in Data types in C++:
`int`  `float`  `char`  `double`  `bool`


#### User-defined Data types in C++:
`Struct`  `Union`  `Enum`


#### Derived Data types in C++:
`Array`  `Function`  `Pointer`
