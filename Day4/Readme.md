## LEcture - 6 Summary
### Topic : C++ header files & operators in C++

There are two types of header files:
1. System header files : It comes with the compiler.
2. User defined header files : It is written by the programmer.<br>
   Syntax of user defined header files<br>
   `include "this.h";`<br>
   `h` is the extension of header files .
   
   One thing need to be insured that any user defined files that is used by program must be defined in the current working directory.

I already know types of operators because of Java , so I will not include the repetitive stuff.
