## Lecture - 7 Summary
### Topic : Reference Variables & Typecasting

By default the scope of each variable is local , to call the global variable we use `::` scope resolution operator .<br>
By default decimal literal _( e.g. 3.45 )_ is `double` to let the compiler know that given number is float we use `f or F` suffix _( e.g. 3.45f )_.<br>
Same goes with `long` .
```c++
float = 3.45f;
long double = 3.45l; //This is long double, this doesn't exist in java.
```
To know the size of a datatype we use `sizeof()` keyword , enter the value in parenthesis which you want to check.<br>
