The first half of the video is already covered in previous days of the document.<br>
And second half of the video ? Here it comes :<br>

**How is data is stored ?**

```              
                         
                    |=======> initialized value 
                    |
            int a = 5;
            /    \
           /      \
          /        \
         /          \
int is 4 Byte        datatype name
  
  
In memory these 4 bytes will be stored like :
1 Byte = 8 bits
4 Byte = 32 bits

Value 5 will be converted into binary then stored in the memory like this:
