**In this lecture we will understand how to convert binary to decimal and vice versa through simple maths.**

**I am not telling anything new you may already know this.**

```c++
If you want to convert a decimal number to bianry number one way is keep dividing the value by 2 

Lets take an example.

Convert 9 to binary
   ______________________________
  | Value  | Quotient | remainder|
  |________|__________|__________|  /|\
  |  9 / 2 |   4      |  1       |   |
  |  4 / 2 |   2      |  0       |   |
  |  2 / 2 |   1      |  0       |   | Take all remainders in bottom to top direction 
  |  1 / 2 |   0      |  1       |   |
  --------------------------------   |
  
  Take the remainder from bottom to top and write down in left to right direction that is 1 0 0 1
  You need to divide the decimal value eveytime and whatever divisor you get you again divide it by 2.
  Keep dividing till the quotient reach 0(we are taking integer and integer don't allow decimal values)
  then take the remainder in the way I showed you top to bottom.
