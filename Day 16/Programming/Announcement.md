Since I already completed Love Babbar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsToJ9zSl4-5BfOBzAR0fm--f">C++ Playlist</a> .
So now I know the basics to kickstart my programming journey.

And in programming world one thing famous to crack the coding interviews. You may already guessed it right.

  <h2> DSA</h2>

You may think that why not master C++ first and then start DSA.

  This gif is more than enough to express my emotions😌
  
I thought I have more than enough knowledge of language and now I can start learning DSA too.
  
One of the best free resource with many reviews I find is Love Babbar(yeah once again this awesome person)YT course.
  
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA">
  DSA playlist</a>
  
  So yeah it is time to start DSA from scratch and by now you already know it that I will document this journey too .<br>
  So I decided to start a new repository ,you may ask why🤷‍♂️? Why not keep adding those DSA notes here in this repo ?<br>
  I don't have much to say on this matter. The only thing is this repo is about c++ not exactly about programming and DSA.<br>
  So I thought why mix both lets keep them seperate for better understanding.<br>
  
  Here is the link of new repo : <a href="https://github.com/ItsAnkitPatel/30-Days-Of-DSA"> 30-Days-Of-DSA</a> now.
  
  
  Hope to see you there too🤝.
