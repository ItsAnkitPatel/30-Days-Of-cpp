**What is Switch**
>You can easily find the definition on google. In short , switch is an alternative of if-else-if ladder.


**Structure of switch**
```c++
switch(expression){
  case constantValue1 : Task you want to do for this specific case
                         break;   (break statement is very important)
  case constantValue2 : Task you want to do for this specific case
                         break;
  .
  .
  .
  n cases as much you want
  
  default : In case no case is matched what you want to do , you can add that here

}
```

**What datatypes are allowed in swithc expression ?**
> `int` , `char` , `short` and yeah `byte` is allowed but there is little workaround you need.
> > `byte` is a enum class std::byte in C++ . So yeah byte is not a primitive datatype.

**Workaround for byte use in switch**

**Can you use switch inside switch ?**
>Yes

```c++
    int num = 1;
    char ch = 'a';

    switch (ch)
    {
    case 1:
        cout << "Case 1 of ch" << endl;
        break;
    case 'a': switch (num)
                {
                case 1 : cout<<"The num value is 1"<<endl;
                    break;
                
                case 2 : cout<<"The num value is 2"<<endl;
                    break;
                default:cout<<"The default case of num"<<endl;
                }
                break;
    }
```
>But I don't think we usually going to need this nested switch at all.

<br>

<img alt="Let me show you something" src="/media/gifs/show-you-something.gif">

```c++
    int num1 = 1;
    int num2 = 2;

    if(num1 == 1 || num2 == 2){
        cout<<"Hello World"<<endl;
    }
```
<br>

**How you will write the above code in switch ?**

```c++
    int num1 = 1;
    int num2 = 2;
    switch (num1)
    {
    case 1:
         case 2 : cout<<"Hello World"<<endl;
    }
```
>default is not mandatory.

**Need of break ?**

We learn better with example, right ? Lets get into it

**Code :**
```c++
    int num =1;
    switch (num)
    {
    case 1: cout<<"Hi"<<endl;
    case 2 : cout<<"Hello ?"<<endl;
    case 3 : cout<<"Please reply"<<endl;
    }
```

**Output**

```
Hi
Hello ?
Please reply
```
>*I hope this is not brining your instagram/facebook days* üòÇ sorry for being too mischievous üôÉ

Now lets get to the point. As you can see in the above example code of Hi hello because there wasn't any break so when the `case 1` start executing
all the other cases also get executed.

**This is the reason why we need break statement after each case.**
