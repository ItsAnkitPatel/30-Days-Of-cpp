**What is Switch**
>You can easily find the definition on google. In short , switch is an alternative of if-else-if ladder.


**Structure of switch**
```c++
switch(expression){
  case constantValue1 : Task you want to do for this specific case
                         break;   (break line is very important)
  case constantValue2 : Task you want to do for this specific case
                         break;
  .
  .
  .
  n cases as much you want
  
  default : In case no case is matched what you want to do , you can add that here

}
```

**What datatypes are allowed in swithc expression ?**
> `int` , `char` , `short` and yeah `byte` is allowed but there is little workaround you need.
> > `byte` is a enum class std::byte in C++ . So yeah byte is not a primitive datatype.
