>If-else and While loop are already covered in previous <a href="/Journey_so_far.md/#day-7">Day 7 notes</a> 

**Before jumping to patterns**

**I found something interesting** (as newbie in C++ it is interesting for me)
When we try to take input from `cin` the space(' ') , tabs(\t) , enter(\n) ignored by `cin` during taking input from the terminal.<br>
But when we try to take input from `cin.get` the story is different<br>
Let me show you how to use cin.get:

```c++
int main(){
    
    int a = cin.get(); //Giving input as 1
    cout<<"The value of a is "<<a<<endl; 
return 0;
}
```
**Output :**
```
The value of a is 49
```

**Why ?**<br>
>cin.get reads the input as character and give output according to the ASCII table of the given input for e.g. for input 1 it gives 49 because character '1' decimal value is 49.<br>
