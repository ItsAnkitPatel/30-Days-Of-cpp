    <b>It's time for some small changeðŸ˜‰<br>
It's been 15 days and so far I have learned many things all thanks to Code With harry YT channel.<br>
Now it's time to change few things , I want to start programming in c++ and for that I choose the Love Babbar 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsToJ9zSl4-5BfOBzAR0fm--f">C++ Playlist</a>

I know I know why so sudden change in the pace ? Why direction of learning is changed ? <br>

<img alt ="Let me explain gif" src="/media/gifs/explain.gif" >
 </div>
The reason is recently I have joined the <i>Coding Blocks Career Bootcamp (as a Student)</i> and in that C++ will be taught and to cope up with the pace I have decided to switch to programming in C++.<br>
Now there might be and I really mean there might be a slight possibility that some of you're thinking that <br>
What we are doing so far from Day 1 to Day 15 is learning programming right ? If you're thinking in that way then the only thing the developer world want to say to you is <br>

  I was in the same boat too ðŸ˜…<br>
</div>
  
  Right now what we are doing is actually learning the concepts of a programming language , we aren't doing programming.You can google it for more info.<br>
  
  And last thing I want to say yes this is temprory for some days only and then I will switch back to Code with Harry C++ playlist for now I will start Love Babbar 
  [this C++ playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsToJ9zSl4-5BfOBzAR0fm--f) and my target is to complete this playlist before `10-01-2023` (random date decided) .</b>
