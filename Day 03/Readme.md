### Topic : Basic I/O in C++

In C++ sequence of bytes corresponding to input and  output are commonly known as **streams**.

**Input Stream** : Direction of flow of bytes takes place from input device (e.g. Keyboard) to the main memory.<br>
**Output Stream** : Direction of flow of bytes takes place from main memory to the output device (e.g. Display)

**Insertion Operator** `<<`: Whatever output is generated show it to the screen that's the role of insertion operator.<br> 
**Extraction Operator** `>>`: Whatever input is given take it, that's the role of extraction operator.
