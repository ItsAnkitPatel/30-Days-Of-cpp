## Lecture - 16 Summary
### Topic : Call by Value & Call by Reference in C++


Let's start by a code example :
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//In this example we will see call by refernece and call by value difference
void swap(int,int); //function prototype

int main(){
    int a =4,b=5;
    cout<<"The value of a "<<a<<" and the value of b is "<<b<<endl;
    swap(a,b);
    cout<<"The value of a "<<a<<" and the value of b is "<<b<<endl;

return 0;
}
void swap(int num1 , int num2){  // temp   num1    num2
    int temp =num1;              // 4      4        5
    num1 = num2;                 // 4      5        5
    num2 = temp;                 // 4      5        4
}
```
**Predict the output ?**<br>

**Is this the Ouput you thinked about ?**
```
The value of a 4 and the value of b is 5
The value of a 5 and the value of b is 4
```

**If yes then you are wrong buddy.**

**Yeah as a beginner this was my reaction too.**<br>
**But this is the fun part of journey right? You encounter with new things and these new things upgrade your knowlege.**

<br>

**So what's the correct ouput ?**<br>
**Here you go :**
```
The value of a 4 and the value of b is 5
The value of a 4 and the value of b is 5
```

**And the reason behind is :** the actual parameters that are passed to `swap` function they are copied to num1 & num2 formal parameters.<br>
In short a different copy is created of 4 & 5 when we passed the values to **swap(num1,num2)** function.<br>
So even we swapped the values between num1 & num2 the values of variable 'a' & 'b' will remain the same because we passed the values only
and those values are copied to num1 & num2 and after that variable 'a' & 'b' have no relation with 'num1 & 'num2'.<br>
**This is called "Pass by Value" .**<br>

**Another small example is :** If you send a text file to your friend and if your friend do any changes in that text file then will those changes will reflect to your file too ? The answer is simple "nope" those changes will not going to show in your text file. Same happen with "pass by value" concept.<br>

**Now what is "Pass by Reference" ?**
