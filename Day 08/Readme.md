### Topic : Break & Continue Statements

**`break` keyword use :**

```c++
int main()
{

    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    {
        if (i == 3)
        {
            break;
        }
        cout <<"The value of i is : "<< i << endl;  
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
The value of i is : 1
The value of i is : 2
```
`break` keyword is used to stop the loop at a certain condition defined by us. <br><br>


**`continue` keyword use:**
```c++
int main()
{

    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    {
        if (i == 3)
        {
            continue;
        }
        cout <<"The value of i is : "<< i << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
The value of i is : 1
The value of i is : 2
The value of i is : 4
The value of i is : 5
```

`continue` keyword is used to skip statements written after continue just like above example we skipped the output for `i =3` . <br>

### Topic : Pointer

**What is a Pointer ?**
>In simple words, Pointer is a datatype which holds the address of other data types.

How to create pointer ?<br>
example :
```c++
int a =3;
int* b = &a;
cout<<"The address of a is : "<<&a<<endl;
cout<<"The address of a is : "<<<b<endl;
```
**Output:**<br>

    The address of a is : 0x7ffcefc2a40c
    The address of a is : 0x7ffcefc2a40c
    
`&` --> **_Address of_**  operator<br>
`*` --> `Dereference` operator also called **_value of_**  operator or we can also say ***value at*** operator.   <br>

**Pointer to Pointer :**
```c++
int a =3;
int* b = &a;
int** c = &b;
cout<<"The address of b is : "<<&b<<endl;
cout<<"The address of b is : "<<c<<endl;
cout<<"The value at address c is : "<<*c<<endl;
cout<<"The value of address value_at(value_at(c)) is : "<<**c<<endl;

```

**Output :**
```
The address of b is : 0x7ffc837a3fa8
The address of b is : 0x7ffc837a3fa8
The value at address c is : 0x7fffc0fa5474
The value of address value_at(value_at(c)) is : 3
```
So here pointer to pointer means

```
pointer c holds address of b --> pointer b --> holds the address of 'a' variable and as we already know the variable 'a' sotres a value.
```

So when we say `*c` we are actually telling the compiler that : show us the address which stored by b pointer variable and in according to above case it will return only address stored by b pointer variable(which is address of `a` variable) .<br>
Conclusion of above statement :<br>
*c == &a(which is hold by `b` pointer) Or we can also say *c == b (adrres of `a` (&a) i.e. is present inside this `b` pointer).<br><br>

And when we say `**c` we are telling the compiler that : show us the value stored at the address of the address which is present inside 'c' pointer.<br>
Conclusion of above statement:<br>
`**c == *b` <br>
I know it's quite consfusing I will try my best to solve your confusion with the help of below diagrams.<br>
<br><br>
When we use `&` operator it tells us the address of the variable.<br>
When we use `*` operator as a suffix with a pointer variable it tells us the value stored at that address which is present inside the pointer(e.g. int* b = &a).<br>
When we use `**` double pointer or we can say pointer to pointer as a suffix with a variable then we are telling the compiler that store the address of a pointer(variable b) inside a pointer( variable c). <br>

```c++
int a  = 3;
int* b = &a;
```

               c 
          
<br><br>
So when we say ` cout<< c `<br>
The output will be: The address of 'b' pointer which is stored by 'c' pointer.<br>

               c

When we say ` cout<< *c `<br>
The output will be: The address present inside 'b' pointer.<br>

                                          |
                                          |      In this case the `c` pointer will call the address stored by pointer `b`

               c

When we say ` cout<< **c `<br>
The output will be :<br>
