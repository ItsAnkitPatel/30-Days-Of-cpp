## Lecture - 15 Summary
### Topic : Functions & Function Prototypes in C++
The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs .<br>
And every program starts from `main()` function and only after that other functions call can start. 


```c++
#include <iostream>
 using namespace std;

int sum(int a, int b){
    int c =  a+b;
    return c;
}
int main(){
    
    int num1,num2;
    cout<<"Enter the first number : "<<endl;
    cin>>num1;
    cout<<"Enter the second number : "<<endl;
    cin>>num2;
    cout<<"The sum of "<<num1<<" + "<<num2<<" = "<<sum(num1,num2)<<endl;
return 0;
}
```
Now what if we define the sum function after main() function ?
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;




int main(){
    
    int num1,num2;
    cout<<"Enter the first number : "<<endl;
    cin>>num1;
    cout<<"Enter the second number : "<<endl;
    cin>>num2;
    cout<<"The sum of "<<num1<<" + "<<num2<<" = "<<sum(num1,num2)<<endl;
return 0;
}

int sum(int a, int b){
    int c =  a+b;
    return c;
}
```
**Will it work ?**

**Output :** <br>

```
Functions.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:
Functions.cpp:14:52: error: ‘sum’ was not declared in this scope
   14 |     cout<<"The sum of "<<num1<<" + "<<num2<<" = "<<sum(num1,num2)<<endl;
      |     
```

>The answer is NO, IT WILL NOT WORK🙅‍♂️. Same thing will happen in Structures,enums,union too.<br>
>If we define all of the functions, structure, enum, union after `main()` function body, it will not work.

Sometimes you may want to define your functions after `main()` fucnction, so what's the solution ?
>**Function prototypes** 🤠
<br>

**What is function prototypes ? 🤔**
>The function prototypes are used to tell the compiler about the number of arguments and about the required datatypes of a function parameter, it also tells about the return type of the function. By this information, the compiler cross-checks the function signatures before calling it.
