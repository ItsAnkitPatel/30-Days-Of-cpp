### Topic : Break & Continue Statements

**`break` keyword use :**

```c++
int main()
{

    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    {
        if (i == 3)
        {
            break;
        }
        cout <<"The value of i is : "<< i << endl;  
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
The value of i is : 1
The value of i is : 2
```
`break` keyword is used to stop the loop at a certain condition defined by us. <br><br>


**`continue` keyword use:**
```c++
int main()
{

    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
    {
        if (i == 3)
        {
            continue;
        }
        cout <<"The value of i is : "<< i << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
The value of i is : 1
The value of i is : 2
The value of i is : 4
The value of i is : 5
```

`continue` keyword is used to skip statements written after continue just like above example we skipped the output for `i =3` . <br>
